	<h4>What Is The Elsewhere Project?</h4>
	<p>The Elsewhere Project is a global platform for open-source journalism.
	<br />
	<br />
	The platform is a fully interactive map of the world. You can click, drag and zoom to parts of the world that matter the most to you and check out articles in that area. Each pin is an article.
	<br>
	<br>

	<h4>What does “a platform for open-source journalism” mean?</h4>
	<p> It means anyone (including you!) can contribute to it. It means that the team of curators who manage the map is massively decentralized, and apply the lightest possible approach to checking content before upload (fact-checking, grammar and spelling - that’s it). Finally, it means the entire project is voluntary, and anyone can copy the code or concept.</p>
	<br>

	<br>
	<p>That means you can write about what places, events and things that matter to you, and literally put those things on the map.</p>
	<hr>
	<h4>What kind of content can be displayed on the map of elsewhere?</h4>
	<p>The only criteria is that posts should be well-researched, around 800 words long, and should be tied to a place, event or thing of which you have real experience. Together, the different your posts and the others like yours make up a worldwide alternative narrative to traditional news. The Elsewhere Project is where the world speaks for itself.</p>
