		<p>Elsewhere is a social journalism platform that anyone can submit to. It favours locally focussed stories with global relevance: like personal testimony of a nationally reported disaster, or reflection on the behaviour of a politician in their constituency set against their career in government.
	<br />
	<br />
        The project aims to offer globally relevant stories that are locally focussed from all over the world, written by ordinary people who are there. It wants to let you read the personal experience behind every news story on Earth.
